\fBRecord Mode\fR enables recording of a signal. This is the default mode.
.TP
.B -p
\fBPassthrough Mode\fR means that the vrecord window will appear with video feeds and scopes, but the incoming video signal will not be recorded to a file. Passthrough mode is best used for tasks like testing equipment or setting up a tape to bars before actually recording. When you are finished using passthrough mode simply close the vrecord window.

.B -a
\fBAudio Passthrough Mode\fR is the same as Passthrough Mode with the addition of audio bars to monitor levels. It can be used to check audio track layout and confirm input levels before starting a transfer. Currently Audio Passthrough Mode does not support the Visual + Numerical view option.
