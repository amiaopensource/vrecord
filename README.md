## Summary

Vrecord is open-source software for capturing a video signal and turning it into a digital file. Its purpose is to make videotape digitization or transfer easier. Vrecord can capture analog and digital signals through a variety of inputs and can create digital video files in a variety of formats and codecs. Vrecord has been designed with needs of audiovisual archivists in mind. 

Vrecord uses MediaAreaâ€™s [ffmpeg-ma](https://github.com/MediaArea/homebrew-mediaarea/blob/master/ffmpeg-ma.rb) to do its dirty work. Other dependencies are: cowsay, [decklinksdk](https://github.com/amiaopensource/homebrew-amiaos/blob/master/decklinksdk.rb), [gtkdialog](https://github.com/amiaopensource/homebrew-amiaos/blob/master/gtkdialog.rb), freetype, sdl and xmlstarlet. Optional dependencies are: deckcontrol, gnuplot, mediaconch, mkvtoolnix, mpv and qcli.

Currently vrecord supports macOS or Linux, and Blackmagic Design capture cards with the Blackmagic driver installed or
AVFoundation for DV capture on macOS. Some notes on [needed hardware](Resources/Documentation/hardware.md) are provided.

If you want to see a more detailed description about how to digitize analog videotape see our document on [analog digitization](Resources/Documentation/analog_digitization.md).
