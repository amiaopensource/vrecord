## Summary

Vrecord is open-source software for capturing a video signal and turning it into a digital file. Its purpose is to make videotape digitization or transfer easier. Vrecord can capture analog and digital signals through a variety of inputs and can create digital video files in a variety of formats and codecs. Vrecord has been designed with needs of audiovisual archivists in mind. 

Vrecord uses AMIA Open Sourceâ€™s [ffmpegdecklink](https://github.com/amiaopensource/homebrew-amiaos/blob/master/ffmpegdecklink.rb) and [mpv](https://mpv.io/) to do its dirty work. Other dependencies are cowsay, mkvtoolnix, qcli and xmlstarlet.

Currently vrecord only supports macOS and Blackmagic Design capture cards with the Blackmagic driver installed. Some notes on [needed hardware](Resources/Documentation/analog_digitization.md) are provided.

If you want to see a more detailed description about how to digitize analog videotape see our document on [analog digitization](Resources/Documentation/analog_digitization.md).
