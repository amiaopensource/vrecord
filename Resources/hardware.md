# Needed Hardware

- a computer running a recent macOS
- a Blackmagic card from:

  - [UltraStudio](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/ultrastudiothunderbolt)
  - [DeckLink](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/decklink)
  - [Intensity Pro 4K](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/intensitypro4k)

  Please note that the Mini Converters donâ€™t work well, because the signal is clipped at broadcast levels.
