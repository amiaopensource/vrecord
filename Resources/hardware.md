- a Blackmagic card from:

  - [DeckLink](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/decklink), except for the DeckLink 4K Extreme card (see https://github.com/amiaopensource/vrecord/issues/209#issuecomment-360862657)

  - [Intensity](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/intensity)
  
  Please note that the Mini Converters donâ€™t work well, because the signal is clipped at broadcast levels.
